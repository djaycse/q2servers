# "instamaps.txt"
# ----------
# Maps for insta-gib railgun only.
#
# Format:
# <map name> [min # of players] [max # of players]
#
# The map queuer will only load a map if its min/max active player counts on the current
# level are within its bounds.  Otherwise, the map will NOT be loaded.
#
# If you dont want player limits on each map, just specify the map with no min/max
# values on each line.
#
# Use a min of 0 for maps that should be rotated through when there is nobody
# on and playing.  Probably should use popular maps for quick pickup games when
# people connect initially.
